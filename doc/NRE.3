This series of C functions provides an interface whereby commands that
are implemented in C can be evaluated, and invoke Tcl commands scripts
and scripts, without consuming space on the C stack. The non-recursive
evaluation is done by installing a \fItrampoline\fR, a small piece of
code that invokes a command or script, and then executes a series of

.PP
The \fBTcl_NRCreateCommand\fR function creates a Tcl command in the
interpreter designated by \fIinterp\fR that is prepared to handle
nonrecursive evaluation with a trampoline. The \fIcmdName\fR argument
gives the name of the new command. If \fIcmdName\fR contains any
namespace qualifiers, then the new command is added to the specified
namespace; otherwise, it is added to the global namespace. \fIproc\fR
gives the procedure that will be called when the interpreter wishes to
evaluate the command in an unoptimized manner, and \fInreProc\fR is
the procedure that will be called when the interpreter wishes to
evaluate the command using a trampoline. \fIdeleteProc\fR is a
function that will be called before the command is deleted from the
interpreter. When any of the three functions is invoked, it is passed
the \fIclientData\fR parameter.
.PP
\fBTcl_NRCreateCommand\fR deletes any existing command
\fIname\fR already associated with the interpreter
(however see below for an exception where the existing command
is not deleted).
It returns a token that may be used to refer
to the command in subsequent calls to \fBTcl_GetCommandName\fR.
If \fBTcl_NRCreateCommand\fR is called for an interpreter that is in
the process of being deleted, then it does not create a new command,
does not delete any existing command of the same name, and returns NULL.
.PP
The \fIproc\fR and \fInreProc\fR function are expected to conform to
all the rules set forth for the \fIproc\fR argument to
\fBTcl_CreateObjCommand\fR(3) (\fIq.v.\fR).
.PP
When a command that is written to cope with evaluation via trampoline
is invoked without a trampoline on the stack, it will usually respond
to the invocation by creating a trampoline and calling the
trampoline-enabled implementation of the same command. This call is done by
means of \fBTcl_NRCallObjProc\fR. In the call to
\fBTcl_NRCallObjProc\fR, the \fIinterp\fR, \fIclientData\fR,
\fIobjc\fR and \fIobjv\fR parameters should be the same ones that were
passed to \fIproc\fR. The \fInreProc\fR parameter should designate the
trampoline-enabled implementation of the command.
.PP
\fBTcl_NREvalObj\fR arranges for the script contained in \fIobjPtr\fR
to be evaluated in the interpreter designated by \fIinterp\fR after
the current command (which must be trampoline-enabled) returns. It is
the method by which a command may invoke a script without consuming
space on the C stack. Similarly, \fBTcl_NREvalObjv\fR arranges to
invoke a single Tcl command whose words have already been separated
and substituted. The \fIobjc\fR and \fIobjv\fR parameters give the
words of the command to be evaluated when execution reaches the
trampoline.
.PP
\fBTcl_NRCmdSwap\fR allows for trampoline evaluation of a command whose
resolution is already known.  The \fIcmd\fR parameter gives a
\fBTcl_Command\fR token (returned from \fBTcl_CreateObjCommand\fR or
\fBTcl_GetCommandFromObj\fR) identifying the command to be invoked in
the trampoline; this command must match the word in \fIobjv[0]\fR.
The remaining arguments are as for \fBTcl_NREvalObjv\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_NREvalObj\fR, \fBTcl_NREvalObjv\fR and \fBTcl_NRCmdSwap\fR
all accept a \fIflags\fR parameter, which is an OR-ed-together set of
bits to control evaluation. At the present time, the only supported flag

If the \fBTCL_EVAL_GLOBAL\fR flag is set, the script or command is
evaluated in the global namespace. If it is not set, it is evaluated
in the current namespace.
.PP
\fBTcl_NRExprObj\fR arranges for the expression contained in \fIobjPtr\fR
to be evaluated in the interpreter designated by \fIinterp\fR after
the current command (which must be trampoline-enabled) returns. It is
the method by which a command may evaluate a Tcl expression without consuming
space on the C stack.  The argument \fIresultPtr\fR is a pointer to an
unshared Tcl_Obj where the result of expression evaluation is to be written.
If expression evaluation returns any code other than TCL_OK, the
\fIresultPtr\fR value is left untouched.
.PP
All of the routines return \fBTCL_OK\fR if command or expression invocation
has been scheduled successfully. If for any reason the scheduling cannot
be completed (for example, if the interpreter is unable to find
the requested command), they return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR with an
appropriate message left in the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_NRAddCallback\fR arranges to have a C function called when the
current trampoline-enabled command in the Tcl interpreter designated
by \fIinterp\fR returns.  The \fIpostProcPtr\fR argument is a pointer
to the callback function, which must have arguments and return value
consistent with the \fBTcl_NRPostProc\fR data type:
=======
These functions provide an interface to the function stack that an interpreter
iterates through to evaluate commands.  The routine behind a command is
implemented by an initial function and any additional functions that the
routine pushes onto the stack as it progresses.  The interpreter itself pushes
functions onto the stack to react to the end of a routine and to exercise other
forms of control such as switching between in-progress stacks and the
evaluation of other scripts at additional levels without adding frames to the C
stack.  To execute a routine, the initial function for the routine is called
and then a small bit of code called a \fItrampoline\fR iteratively takes
functions off the stack and calls them, using the value of the last call as the
value of the routine.
.PP
\fBTcl_NRCallObjProc\fR calls \fInreProc\fR using a new trampoline.
.PP
\fBTcl_NRCreateCommand\fR, an alternative to \fBTcl_CreateObjCommand\fR,
resolves \fIcmdName\fR, which may contain namespace qualifiers, relative to the
current namespace, creates a command by that name, and returns a token for the
command which may be used in subsequent calls to \fBTcl_GetCommandName\fR.
Except for a few cases noted below any existing command by the same name is
first deleted.  If \fIinterp\fR is in the process of being deleted
\fBTcl_NRCreateCommand\fR does not create any command, does not delete any
command, and returns NULL.
.PP
\fBTcl_NREvalObj\fR pushes a function that is like \fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR but
consumes no space on the C stack.
.PP
\fBTcl_NREvalObjv\fR pushes a function that is like \fBTcl_EvalObjv\fR but
consumes no space on the C stack.
.PP
\fBTcl_NRCmdSwap\fR is like \fBTcl_NREvalObjv\fR, but uses \fIcmd\fR, a token
previously returned by \fBTcl_CreateObjCommand\fR or
\fBTcl_GetCommandFromObj\fR, instead of resolving the first word of \fIobjv\fR.
.  The name of this command must be the same as \fIobjv[0]\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_NRExprObj\fR pushes a function that evaluates \fIobjPtr\fR as an
expression in the same manner as \fBTcl_ExprObj\fR but without consuming space
on the C stack.
.PP
All of the functions return \fBTCL_OK\fR if the evaluation of the script,
command, or expression has been scheduled successfully.  Otherwise (for example
if the command name cannot be resolved), they return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and store
a message as the interpreter's result.
.PP
\fBTcl_NRAddCallback\fR pushes \fIpostProcPtr\fR.  The signature for
\fBTcl_NRPostProc\fR is:
>>>>>>> upstream/master
.PP
.CS
typedef int
\fBTcl_NRPostProc\fR(
        \fBvoid *\fR \fIdata\fR[],
        \fBTcl_Interp\fR *\fIinterp\fR,
        int \fIresult\fR);
.CE
.PP
\fIdata\fR is a pointer to an array containing \fIdata0\fR through \fIdata3\fR.
\fIresult\fR is the value returned by the previous function implementing part
the routine.
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
The following command uses \fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR, which consumes space on the C
stack, to evalute a script:
.PP
.CS
int
\fITheCmdOldObjProc\fR(
    void *clientData,
    Tcl_Interp *interp,
    int objc,
    Tcl_Obj *const objv[])
{
    int result;
    Tcl_Obj *objPtr;

    \fI... preparation ...\fR

    result = \fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR(interp, objPtr, 0);

    \fI... postprocessing ...\fR

    return result;
}
\fBTcl_CreateObjCommand\fR(interp, "theCommand",
        \fITheCmdOldObjProc\fR, clientData, TheCmdDeleteProc);
.CE
.PP
To avoid consuming space on the C stack, \fITheCmdOldObjProc\fR is renamed to
\fITheCmdNRObjProc\fR and the postprocessing step is split into a separate
function, \fITheCmdPostProc\fR, which is pushed onto the function stack.
\fITcl_EvalObjEx\fR is replaced with \fITcl_NREvalObj\fR, which uses a
trampoline instead of consuming space on the C stack.  A new version of
\fITheCmdOldObjProc\fR is just a a wrapper that uses \fBTcl_NRCallObjProc\fR to
call \fITheCmdNRObjProc\fR:
.PP
.CS
int
\fITheCmdOldObjProc\fR(
